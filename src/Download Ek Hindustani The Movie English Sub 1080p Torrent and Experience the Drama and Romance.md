The film's soundtrack was composed by Anand Raj Anand and featured songs like "Mohabbat Ko Hum Chhod De", "Aao Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage" and "Dilruba". The film also had a special appearance by Danny Denzongpa. The film was shot in various locations like Mumbai, Goa and Kashmir. The film's trailer and songs were released on various platforms, but the film never saw the light of the day.
 
The reason for the film's shelving is not clear, but some sources suggest that it was due to Sunil Shetty's poor market value as a solo hero at that time. Some also say that the film faced some legal issues or financial troubles. Whatever the reason, the film remains a mystery for the fans of Sunil Shetty and Raveena Tandon, who were once a popular on-screen pair.
 
However, some curious netizens have tried to find the film online and have searched for keywords like "Ek Hindustani The Movie English Sub 1080p Torrent". But they have only found some fake or irrelevant links that lead to nowhere. The film is not available on any official streaming platform or DVD either. It seems that the film is lost forever and only exists in some old tapes or hard drives.
 
Ek Hindustani is one of those Bollywood films that had a lot of potential but never got a chance to prove itself. It is a shame that such a film is buried in obscurity and has no audience. Maybe someday, someone will find the film and release it for the public to see. Until then, Ek Hindustani remains a forgotten gem of Bollywood.
  
Ek Hindustani is not the only Bollywood film that has been shelved or delayed for various reasons. There are many other films that have faced similar fate and have remained unseen by the audience. Some of these films are:
