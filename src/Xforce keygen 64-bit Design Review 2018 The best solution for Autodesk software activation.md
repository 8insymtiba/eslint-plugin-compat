## Aigiri Nandini Lyrics in English with Meaning

    Ayi giri nandini, nandhitha medhini,
    Viswa vinodhini nandanuthe,
    Girivara vindhya sirodhi nivasini,
    Vishnu Vilasini Jishnu nuthe,
    Bhagawathi hey sithi kanda kudumbini,
    Bhoori kudumbini bhoori kruthe,
    Jaya Jaya he Mahishasura mardini,
    Ramya kapardini, shaila Suthe.
    
    Victory and victory to you, Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
    Who makes the whole earth happy,
    Who rejoices with this universe,
    Who is the daughter of Nanda,
    Who resides on the peak of the great Vindhya mountain,
    Who plays with Lord Vishnu,
    Who has a glittering mien,
    Who is praised by other goddesses,
    Who is the consort of the lord with the blue neck,
    Who has several families,
    Who does good to her family.
    Who has captivating braided hair,
    Who is the daughter of a mountain.
    And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
    
    Suravara varshini, durdara darshini,
    Durmukhamarshani, harsha rathe,
    Tribhuvana poshini, Sankara thoshini,
    Kilbisisha moshini, ghosha rathe,
    Danuja niroshini, Dithisutha roshini,
    Durmatha soshini, Sindhu suthe,
    Jaya Jaya he Mahishasura mardini ,
    Ramya kapardini, shaila Suthe.
    
    Victory and victory to you, Oh darling daughter of the mountain,
    Oh goddess who showers boons on devas,
    Who punishes those who are undisciplined.
    Who tolerates ugly faced ogres,
    Who enjoys in being happy,
    Who looks after the three worlds,
    Who pleases lord Shiva,
    Who removes effect of sins,
    Who rejoices with the holy sound,
    Who is angry on the progenies of Dhanu (demon),
    Who is angry with the children of Diti (also demon),
    Who discourages those with pride,
    Who is the daughter of the Ocean,
    Who has captivating braided hair,
    Who is the daughter of a mountain.
    And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
    
    Ayi Jagadambha Madambha , Kadambha
    Vana priya vasini, Hasarathe
    Shikhari siromani, thunga Himalaya
    Srunga nijalaya, madhyagathe
    Madhu Madure, Mdhukaitabha banjini
    Kaitabha banjini, rasa rathe
    Jaya Jaya he Mahishasura mardini ,
    Ramya kapardini, shaila Suthe.
    
    Victory and victory to you, Oh darling daughter of the mountain
    Oh , mother of the entire world
    One who loves to live in a forest of Kadamba trees
    One who keeps on smiling
    One who is on her own dwelling on the tall peak of the Himalaya
    The greatest among the mountains
    One who is very sweet like honey
    One who has the treasure of demons Madhu and Kaitabha
    Destroyer of the demon Kaitabha
    Engaged in dancing
    One who has captivating braided hair
    Daughter of a mountain
    And who is the slayer of Mahishasura.
    
    Ayi satha kanda, vikanditha runda
    Vithunditha shunda Gajathipathe
    Ripu Gaja ganda , Vidhaarana chanda
    Paraakrama shunda Mrugathipathe
    Nija bhuja danda nipathitha khanda
    Vipathitha munda Bhatathipathe
    Jaya Jaya he Mahishasura mardini ,
    Ramya kapardini, shaila Suthe.
    
    Victory and victory to you, Oh darling daughter of the mountain
    Oh one who split into pieces those hundred headed demons
    And one who cut off those trunks of great battle elephants
    One who punished those enemy elephants with huge body and head
    One who has great strength and courage to destroy them all
    One who is like a lion in killing these enemies like deer 
    One who made her own arms her weapons 
    And made them 8cf37b1e13
