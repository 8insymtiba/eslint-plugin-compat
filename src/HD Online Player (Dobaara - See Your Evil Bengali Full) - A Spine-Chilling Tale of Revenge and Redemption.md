The movie wastes the talent of its cast, who try their best to deliver decent performances. Huma Qureshi and Saqib Saleem have a good chemistry as the siblings, but their characters are poorly written and developed. Adil Hussain and Lisa Ray are wasted in their roles as the parents, who have very little screen time and impact. Madalina Bellariu Ion is the only one who stands out as the mysterious woman in the mirror, who has a creepy and sinister presence.
 
Dobaara: See Your Evil is a movie that fails to live up to its potential. It is a dull and boring horror movie that does not scare or entertain the audience. It is a movie that you can skip without missing anything.
