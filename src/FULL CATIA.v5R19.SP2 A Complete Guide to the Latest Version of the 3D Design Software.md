A Hot-Fix is a software maintenance package containing a small number of code fixes, designed to fix a small number of critical problems. A Hot-Fix enables a customer to receive fixes for urgent problems, without having to wait for the next service pack. Unlike the General Availability (GA) and Service Pack (SP) levels, which are scheduled, periodic releases, Hot-Fix releases are not periodically scheduled. Simply requesting a Hot-Fix does not automatically guarantee that the customer will receive it: all Hot-Fix requests first must be approved and accepted by Dassault Systemes prior to delivery. Furthermore, a Hot-Fix may contain fixes related to problems reported earlier by different customers. All the files included in the Hot-Fix will nevertheless be installed.
