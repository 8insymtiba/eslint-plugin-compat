One of the most distinctive features of the Roots SDX Vol.1 â Sticks library is the presence of Roy âFuturemanâ Wooten as the drummer and producer. Wooten is a visionary musician who has invented several unique instruments, such as the Drumitar, a guitar-shaped controller that triggers drum sounds, and the RoyEl, a keyboard that plays notes based on the periodic table of elements and the golden ratio. Wooten is also a master of various drumming styles, from jazz and fusion to funk and world music.
 
Wootenâs approach to recording the Roots SDX Vol.1 â Sticks library was to capture every drum hit and cymbal swirl as part of a musical sequence, rather than as a solitary, monotonous hit. He played each drum kit with different dynamics, articulations and expressions, creating a rich and organic sound that can be easily tweaked and manipulated in Superior Drummer 3. Wooten also recorded some custom MIDI grooves that showcase his musicality and versatility.
 
The Roots SDX Vol.1 â Sticks library was recorded at the legendary Blackbird Studio in Nashville, TN, one of the most renowned and well-equipped studios in the world. The studio boasts a collection of over 1,400 microphones, 35 channels of Pultec EQ, 24 channels of Fairchild compression and hundreds of outboard mic/pre channels from brands like Telefunken, Neve, API, RCA and Chandler. The library features 23 separately recorded channels that can be mixed and matched in Superior Drummer 3âs mixer section.
