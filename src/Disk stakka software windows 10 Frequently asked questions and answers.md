## Step 1: Download and Install OpdiTracker
 
The first step is to download the latest version of OpdiTracker from the official website: [https://www.opditracker.com/download.html](https://www.opditracker.com/download.html). Choose the version that matches your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit) and save the file to your computer.
 
Next, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.
 
## Step 2: Connect and Configure Disk Stakka
 
Now that you have installed OpdiTracker, you can connect your Disk Stakka device to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the device is plugged into a power outlet and turned on.
 
Open OpdiTracker and click on the "Settings" button on the toolbar. In the "General" tab, make sure the "Auto Detect" option is checked. This will allow OpdiTracker to recognize your Disk Stakka device automatically.
 
In the "Advanced" tab, you can adjust some settings such as the disc eject speed, the disc scan mode, and the disc label font. You can also enable or disable the sound effects and the LED lights on the device.
 
## Step 3: Add and Manage Your Discs
 
Once you have configured your Disk Stakka device, you can start adding and managing your discs using OpdiTracker. To add a new disc, simply insert it into the device and wait for it to scan. OpdiTracker will create a virtual image of the disc and store it in its database. You can then edit the disc information such as the title, the category, the description, and the keywords.
 
To find a disc, you can use the search function or browse by category. OpdiTracker will show you the location of the disc in your device and allow you to eject it with a click of a button. You can also view the contents of the disc using the built-in viewer or open it with your preferred application.
 
To remove a disc, simply eject it from the device and delete it from OpdiTracker. You can also move or copy discs between different devices if you have more than one Disk Stakka connected to your computer.
